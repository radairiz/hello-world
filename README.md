Hello there!

Radam√©s here, I've done previous scripts for research or classes using VBA, Python, Matlab, R, among other stuff.
My last job was as an intern on a startup working on developing habitats for the Moon and doing some project management.
Guess that will in the future make me an ancient astronaut or a visionary engineer.
